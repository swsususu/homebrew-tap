  # Only macOS is relevant: the app reads IOKit power data and talks to the SMC.
  # This form already means "Ventura or newer". The floor is a conservative
  # guess, not a tested one — Trickle is verified on macOS 27 only. Adjust it
  # once older versions have actually been run.

  # The app is ad-hoc signed, not notarised, so Gatekeeper blocks it on first
  # launch. Homebrew does NOT work around this: it sets the quarantine flag's
  # "user approved" bit, but macOS still refuses an app it cannot verify.
  # Verified by installing this cask and getting the "Apple could not verify"
  # dialog. Only notarisation with an Apple Developer certificate removes it.
  caveats <<~CAVEATS
    Trickle is not notarised yet, so macOS will refuse to open it the first
    time. Either right-click the app and choose Open, or run:

      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Trickle.app
  CAVEATS
